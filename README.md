#1.My head is at the wrong end!

You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

Simples!

#2.To square(root) or not to square(root)

Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.

Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:

If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.

[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]

The input array will always contain only positive numbers and will never be empty or null.

The input array should not be modified!

#3.Recursive Replication

You need to design a recursive function called replicate which will receive arguments times and number.

The function should return an array containing repetitions of the number argument. For instance, replicate(3, 5) should return [5,5,5]. If the times argument is negative, return an empty array.

As tempting as it may seem, do not use loops to solve this problem.
